                        <p class="text">A city located approx 35 km from Dhar and 100 km away from Indore and is a major tourist attraction of the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is located in the Malwa region. it’s official language is Hindi. Mandav or Mandu, back in its days was an important military outpost due to its strategic position and natural defenses- The Vindhya Range of mountains and the river Narmada which blocked the enemy’s way, thus leaving North as the only direction to enter from and the three gates to enter the fortified city of Mandu- Alamgir Gate, Bhangi Gate and the Delhi Gate. After the Bhangi Gate the road branches out to the Delhi Gate and Gadi Gate. The extensive and now mainly deserted hill top fort of Mandu is one of the most interesting sights in central India. It’s on an isolated outcrop separated from the table land to the north by a deep and wide valley called Kakra Khoh which encircles it on the east, west and north, over which a natural causeway runs to the main city gate. To the south of Mandu the land drops steeply away to the main plain far below and the view is superb. Deep ravines cut into the sides of the 20 sq. km plateau occupied by the fort. The ruins are spread over an area of 21 sq. km. The Muslim rulers dubbed it Shadiabad or the City of Joy.</p>

                            <p class="text"><a href="#" class="cg-link"><b>Jahaz Mahal</b></a><br>The splendid architecture of Jahaz Mahal occupies an expense in the Mandu region of Madhya Pradesh. It was built during the reign of Mandu Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji, who is believed to have as many as 15,000 women as his consorts. To accommodate the women belonging to the royal consortium, Jahaz Mahal was built in second half of the 15th century. Jahaz Mahal best captures the medieval history of Mundu. Here 'Jahaz' refers to a ship and 'Mahal' refers to a palace, which is a reflection of the edifice itself. Surrounded by pond water, it seems to be floating gently above the surface of the water.</p>
                            <p class="text"><a href="#" class="cg-link"><b>Rani Rupmati's Pavilion</b></a><br>If history is to be believed, this building was erected because Rani Rupmati, a very beautiful Hindu singer had supposedly caught the interest of Baz Bahadur.                               So, Baz Bahadur using all his clout and wealth built this magnificent piece of architecture to showcase his love for her. It is constructed on the banks of river Narmada because it is believed that Rani Rupmati was so much in awe of the river that she would not even drink water unless she saw the Narmada river. This place is still squeaky clean as the earlier times.                                 </p>
                            <p class="text"><a href="#" class="cg-link"><b>Hindola Mahal</b></a><br>Hindola Mahal in Mandu is a very popular tourist attraction which means Swinging Palace as per its English translation. The grandeur of the Durbar halls can be seen in the opulent palace which served as a royal court to Ghiyas-al-Din Sultan during his reign. It perfectly portrays the Malwa-Sultanate architecture. The innovative structure of the sculpture combined with the superb technique attracts thousands of tourists to pay a visit every year. The Mahal was constructed from sandstone with exquisitely carved columns with the provision of hot and cold water connected with the rooms situated underground.</p>
                            <p class="text"><a href="#" class="cg-link"><b>Ashrafi Mahal</b></a><br>Initially built with the idea of promoting education, this edifice was a school before its builder Mahmud Shah Khilji decided to extend it and make it his very own empire.                                Due to incompetent architectural designs, this building could not withstand for long and soon collapsed. It hasn't been rehabilitated since then and it now stands amidst ruins. The complicated carvings can still be seen on the top of the stairway</p>
