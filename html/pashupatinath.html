Lord Shiva is worshipped here as Pashupatinath and is the main deity here. Thousands of pilgrims pay a visit to this temple every day. It is considered a sacred place of worship, especially among the Hindus. The temple sees massive devotees during special occasions and the temple committee comprising of twenty-five members plans the activities well in advance.<br><br>Mandsaur’s main attraction is the Pashupatinath Temple. This temple has been built many decades ago. It has beautiful effigy that is built-up smooth, with a glowing dark coppery fiery rock-block.<br>The idol of this temple is divided into two parts and there are four faces on the upper section of the deity and the remaining four faces on the lower section.
                            The famous shrine has four doors which pave the way to four different directions, for example, north, south, east and west. Each direction consists of two faces displaying the eight rasas namely, the east stands for peace and concentration, the west for the Rudra form or angry, the north full of snakes and hairs and the south for gentle and artistic.<br><br>Additionally, the Shivalinga of this holy place of worship consists of eight faces. Every part has four faces which portray the four stages of life. It is a unique sculpture of Lord Shiva in the world.
                            The temple is 90 feet in length and is 30 feet wide and 101 feet tall. In addition, it has one golden pitcher of 100 kg each placed on the top of the shrine.
                            The Shivalinga of this popular and sacred place of worship is 2.5*3.2 meters and weighs 4.6 tons.The idol is believed to be found during the summers of 1940 when the water level was declining from the Shivna River.  Many people find it strange but till now, the water level in the Shivna Riverrises to 90 feet to touch the holy Shiv Ling of lord Shiva. This phenomenon during the monsoon is termed as “Jalaabhishek” which means worshiping the Almighty through the water.<br><br>Mondays are considered very auspicious by the devotees as it is said that the idol of Lord Shiva had emerged from the waters of Shivna River on this day. It reached the Tapeshwar Ghat of the river on Sunday and was positioned there. After exactly, 21 years, 5 months and 4 days the deity was incarnated. This day of the incarnation is celebrated with great pomp by the pilgrims.</p>
