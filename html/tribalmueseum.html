With large colourful displays, the museum shows the art, traditions, daily life, and customs of a large number of indigenous groups.<br><br>The museum has a particular focus on tribal art and how it relates to the culture. A musical instrument, for example, is also a part of an important ritual. A sculpture is also a tribute to a god or spiritual energy. For the tribes, everything is related to an invisible power and items are both practical and supernatural at the same time.<br>The museum has a particular focus on tribal art and how it relates to the culture. A musical instrument, for example, is also a part of an important ritual. A sculpture is also a tribute to a god or spiritual energy. For the tribes, everything is related to an invisible power and items are both practical and supernatural at the same time.<br><br>Retaining the authenticity and richness of the tribal culture and traditions, this gallery showcases the homes of the tribes-Gond,Korku, Bhil, Sahariya, while highlighting their dependency on natural resources. The houses in the gallery are made up of mud, bamboo, dung, hay, grass also portraying the essentials such as agricultural tools, earthenware used by the people from tribal communities.<br>Another gallery at the museum literally celebrates different traditions associated with weddings and festivals of the tribal communities. The piousness associated with each natural resource like forests, flowers, leaves, farms with sculptures of men and women have been brought to life by artists. Significance of a 'vivah mandap' at the centre, musical instruments like Dholak and Damru hanging from the revered banyan, and relevance of other rituals, have been colorfully portrayed. Additionally, the mythical relevance of bamboo originating from the story of 'Baasin Kanya' (Gond folklore) is narrated with much fervor and beauty.<br><Br>The moment you step inside this gallery you relive your childhood! Age old games like 'Ghoda Badam Shahi', the traditional tug of war and more will take you back in times when these games were played outside every household. The sculptures of men, women and specially children playing these games are created in a way that one gets the real feel of these games. The section underscores the usage of natural materials for fun and leisurely pursuits.</p>
