                        <p class="text" id="texttospeech">Pench Tiger Reserve comprises the Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park and the Pench Mowgli Sanctuary. It is named after the Pench river that flows through it.Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli's adventure and his battle with the furious Sher Khan is based on this very landscape in Madhya Pradesh. The places described in the 'The Jungle Book' are the locations marked at Alikatta village and the Seeonee hills. This is the reason, Pench Tiger Reserve is also popularly known as 'Land of The Jungle Book'.<br><br>Pench National park, nestling in the lower southern reaches of the satpuda hills is named after Pench river, meandering through the park from north to south. It is located on the southern boundary of Madhya Pradesh, bordering Maharashtra, in the districts of Seoni and Chhindwara.Pench National Park, comprising of 758 SQ Kms, out of which a core area of 299 sq km of Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park and the Mowgli Pench Sanctuary and remaining 464 sq km of pench national park is the buffer area.<br><br>Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli's adventure and his battle with the furious Sher Khan is based on this very landscape in Madhya Pradesh. The places described in the 'The Jungle Book' are the locations marked at Alikatta village and the Seeonee hills. This is the reason, Pench Tiger Reserve is also popularly known as 'Land of The Jungle Book'.<br><br>It is also interesting to know that the one best wildlife series on tigers so far, 'Tiger : Spy in the Jungle' is also filmed in Pench National Park. The series was shot with the use of `trunk cams' ; the cameras held by elephants' trunks, to follow four newborn tiger cubs all the way to adulthood.<br><br>The undulating topography supports a mosaic of vegetation ranging from moist, sheltered valleys to open, dry deciduous forest. Over 1200 species of plants have been recorded from the area including several rare and endangered plants as well as plants of ethno-botanical importance.<br><br>The area has always been rich in wildlife. It is dominated by fairly open canopy, mixed forests with considerable shrub cover and open grassy patches. The high habitat heterogeneity favours high population of Chital and Sambar. Pench tiger reserve has highest density of herbivores in India (90.3 animals per sq km).<br><br>The major attractions of the Pench Tiger Reserves are jungle walk, jungle safari, night safari, trekking, wildlife viewing from machaan and village tour.</p>
