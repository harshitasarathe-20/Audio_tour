Lord Shiva in the form of Pashupatinath is the principal deity here. The highlight is a unique Shiv Ling with eight faces of Lord Shiva. The eight-faced idol is still the same as it was left by the sculptors in that era, the lower faces have been partially worked upon and they are not as clear as the upper four faces. The shrine has four doors in four directions.</p>
                            <p class="text">The Shiv Ling in the temple is 8′ x 10.5′ and weighs 4.6 tons. The temple built on the river is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide and 101 feet tall.
