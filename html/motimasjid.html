The beautiful mosque in white marble is a treat to the eyes and gives a feel of peace and serenity. Over the centuries this monument has stood the test of time and today it attracts tourists and devotees from all corners of the country.<br><br>The Moti Masjid was built by Sikander Jehan Begum, the daughter of Qadsia Begum in the year 1860. Saikander Jahan’s era is considered as the golden era in Bhopal’s history. She was a powerful ruler trained in Martial art and fought many a battle during her tenure. She succeeded her mother in the year of 1844 to become the ruler of Bhopal. Unlike other women of her time, she was driven by modern ideologies and practices. She was against the purdah system and thus never used veil in her entire life. She abolished slavery and was in favor of providing equal rights to everyone. It is only during her tenure, that women in Bhopal for the first time got a taste of liberty and modern beliefs. The Begums of 19th century constructed many glorious monuments and Moti Masjid is one of them.<br><br>Situated in the heart of the city, the architecture of this mosque to a great extent resembles the Jama Masjid of Delhi. Moti Masjid is also known by the name, Pearl mosque. The Mosque looks marvelous with two red towers with golden spikes at the top amidst white marvel architecture. Moti Masjid, a symbol of women power and bravery stands with pride showcasing the golden era of Begums of Bhopal. Over the centuries this mosque has retained its charm and is considered one of the revered places amongst the followers of Islam.<br>The 19th century Moti Masjid with a white marble facade, two small cupolas at the top, two dark red spires or minarets adds to the beauty of the place. Artistically crafted minarets of Moti Masjid are considered as the 'gate from heaven and earth'.</p>
