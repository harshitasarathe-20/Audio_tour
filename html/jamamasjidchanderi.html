The town that has been literally at the crossroads of history has been influenced by different cultures over the centuries. The legacy and influence of different cultures can be seen even today in the many monuments and archaeological sites that dot Chanderi and its surroundings. The Jama Masjid Chanderi is an example of the fusion of the Malwa and Islamic architectural styles. To get an idea of the history of the region in a microcosm, we recommend a visit to the ASIâ€™s (Archaeological Survey of India) Chanderi Museum.<br><Br>The dry branches of a tree that stands inside an open courtyard partly hide the two domes of the Jama Masjid in Chanderi. However, we can clearly see the final that crowns the domes and are intrigued by the sight. We see an Amalaka and a Kalasa, elements of architecture that are normally associated with the shikharas of Hindu temples. The Jama Masjid Chanderi speaks volumes of the secular fabric of Chanderi across the passage of time.<br><br>The Jama Masjid in Chanderi, like many of the Islamic monuments that are scattered in and around Chanderi, is believed to have been built during the 15th century AD. That century seems to have witnessed a building spree in Chanderi, especially under the rule of Mahmud Khalji.Not much is known about the genesis and the history of the Jama Masjid Chanderi. Our secondary research found that some sites on the net say that the Jama Masjid Chanderi was built by Ghiyas Ud Din Balban (1261-1287). However, according to the Archaeological Survey of India, the Jama Masjid in Chanderi was built in the 15th century, no later than 1450 AD, based on the architectural features.<br><br>A beautiful arched porch leads into the inner courtyard. The arched entrance in the porch is flanked by two beautiful arched windows. The inner courtyard which is open to the sky measures 31.42 X 24.38 metres. On the western side is the Sanctuary (holy place).The Quibla or the holy wall in the mosque that faces Mecca has a series of ornate and beautifully carved Mihrabs (Prayer niche). The roof is topped by domes which are crowned with Shikhara style Padmakosa, Kalasa, and Amalaka. all elements fused from Malwa architecture.<br>Outside the Jama Masjid stands a quaint and picturesque ancient structure, that we were told was a later addition and was a rest house for weary travellers.</p>
