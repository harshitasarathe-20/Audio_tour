By covering an area of 542.67 sq km, Panna Reserve lies besides the areas of the Ken River at the central state of India, Madhya Pradesh at a distance of 57 km from Khajuraho, a world heritage center. Panna Tiger Reserve was being found as the best managed and maintained national parks of India by the Ministry of Tourism of India and this reputation brought the park the Award of Excellence in the year 2007. Thanks to all the efforts of Mr. R. Shreenivasa Murthy, a forest officer of the area who brought his best efforts to bring the Panna Park as the best managed and developed park in the area, in collaboration with his team.<br><br>Panna National Reserve was established in the year 1981 by the Government of India. This 22nd tiger reserve of India that was recognized under the project tiger was also declared as a Project Tiger Reserve in the year 1994. The area of Panna also included some of the major parts of the former Gangau Wildlife Sanctuary which was created in the year 1975. The reserved forests of the Reserve in Panna district and some protected forests on Chhatarpur district were the hunting preserves of the erstwhile rulers of Panna, Chhatarpur and Bijawar princely states. Today the area of Ganagu Sanctuary is the part of the territorial forests of the present North Panna Forest division to which a portion of the Chattrapur Forest division was also added later.<br><br>It was in the year 2008 that the real story starts when the reserve area of Panna lost all its tigers to poaching leaving only 2-4 tigers left. Gradually, it caused the loss of the morale of the staff of Panna jungle authority and so in the following year, i.e. in 2009 Mr. R. Shreenivasa Murthy, IFS as field director of Panna Tiger Reserve initiated the task of reintroducing tigers into the park. In collaboration with WWF and PATA, Murthy introduced two tigers to Panna, one from Bandhavgarh and the other from Panna Tiger Reserve with intricate scientific inputs.<br>In the tropical region of Panna the climate of the reserve area is sometimes so pleasant, sometime so scorching during summers but with heavy rainfalls the area is again plush with greenery to make the ambience more appealing.<br><br>Ken River flows through this reserve and creates beautiful waterfalls on its way to the valley. The park has numerous sites of historical importance with stone paintings dating back to Neolithic era. The ideal home to Indian tigers, Panna is composed of deciduous forests to include other species like Indian wolf, four-horned antelope, sloth bear pangolin, rusty spotted cat, leopard, carcal and gharial.<br><br>Under this project Mr. Murthy and his team translocated one male from Pench and a tigress from Kanha with proper monitoring and protection, where they achieved successful breeding to bring four litters to them. Since then, the officials are focusing on the reproduction of more and more cubs in the area to maintain the previous counts of the tigers in Panna.<br><br>Today Panna is the most outstanding, well-managed habitat for all those miscellaneous wildlife creatures of India. The national park is an ideal home to variety of flora and fauna including vultures, cheetals, chinkaras, sambhar and sloth bears. Panna is also an ideal home to the king of the jungles- the royal tigers (Panthera tigris) along with his fellow beings leopard (Panthera pardus), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), wolf (Canis lupus), hyaena (Hyaena hyaena), caracal (Felus caracal) and other smaller cats.The wooded areas are dotted with sambar, the largest of Indian deers, chital and chowsingha. One can easily see nilgai and chinkara in most open areas in the grasslands, especially on the periphery.<br>The number of bird species found in Panna is 200 that include the migratory counts. One can find the species like white necked stork, bareheaded goose, honey Buuzzard, King vulture, Blossom headed Parakeet, Paradise flycatcher, Slaty headed Scimitar babbler for the most chirping and wildering effects in Panna.<br><br>The areas of Panna Tiger Reserve have dry and hot climate. Such climate brings the dry Teak and dry mixed forest by coupling with shallow Vindhyan soils. The dominating vegetation type is miscellaneous dry deciduous forest inter spread with grassland areas. Other major forest types are open grasslands, open woodlands and riverines with tall grasses and thorny woodlands. The characteristic floral species discovered in this area are Tectona grandis, Diospyros melanoxylon, Madhuca indica, Buchnania latifolia, Anogeissus latifolia, Anogeissus pendula, Lannea coromandelica, Bosswelia serrata etc.</p>
