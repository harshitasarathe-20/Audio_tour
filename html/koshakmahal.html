                        <h3>One of the best sights of Chanderi - Sandstone marvel</h3>
                        <p class = "text"  id="texttospeech">The Koshak Mahal is an important historical monument in the small town of Chanderi in Ashoknagar district of Madhya Pradesh.Koshak Mahal is one of the most scenic attractions of Chanderi. Completely built in stone it rises four storeys high. Built in the 15th century, by the Malwa Sultanate, some say after the victory of the Turkish invader Khilji over another Turkish king Mahmud of Jaunpur.<br> <br>This victory monument constructed by Sultan of Malwa is a mystery box of sorts. Initially planned as a seven storey building, the grungy structure has just three complete storeys. Mehmud Shah Khilji constructed this building to memorialise his victory over Sultan Mehmood Sharki in the battle of Kalpi. It is also said that the Sultan constructed this monument in order to provide employment to the people around the area.<br><br>The reason for forced employment was due to the shortage of pay and because peasants were not working with the ruse of battle won over at Kalpi. The stone used in the construction not only added beauty to the monument but also ended up creating two water bodies. The stone was quarried from Fatehabad and Chhiyoli River, which resulted in Mallukha and Sultania ponds.<br><br>The structure bears unique ceiling designs in each of the chambers and the window carvings are also different for each of the four quarters within this square structure. Though it is very unclear if the seven floors were constructed or they crumbled over time, but the present day top floor provides a fantastic view of the paddy fields lined up all across the region. A visit to this structure early in the morning would be best to behold the intricate designs and fantastic architecture.<br><br>Only three and a half storeys survive now but it tells the story of what it would have been in its heyday. Built completely in stone it has a central square from which four paths emanate, flanked by pillared corridors on each side. It was used for many purposes during the course of its history.</p>
