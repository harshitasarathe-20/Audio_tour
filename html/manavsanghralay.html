By early 1979, the establishment was shifted to Bhopal on allotment of a 200 acre campus by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. The status of the Museum was converted from the 'Subordinate Office' into an √Åutonomous Organisation in March 1985, and the 'Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya Samiti' was entrusted to control and supervise the programmes and activities of the Sangrahalaya. Subsequently as an extention of the Sangrahalaya, Southern Regional Centre at Mysore started functioning since October, 2001 from a heritage building 'Wellington House' allotted by the Government of Karnataka. <br><br>The mandate of the Sangrahalaya include: presentation of an integrated story of bio-cultural evolution of humankind through outdoor and indoor exhibitions by highlighting the richness and diversity of cultural patterns of India and its underlying unity; to act as a centre of research and training in museology and generate a new museum movement in India and to present and preserve variety of cultural life. IGRMS is also working for national integration, and promote research & training and inter-organizational networking for salvage and revitalization of vanishing, but valuable cultural traditions. The innovative aspects of the organisation are its open-air and indoor exhibitions, built with active involvement of traditional artisans and experts drawn from different community groups, and the education, outreach & salvage activities in different parts of the country. Through its exhibitions, education programmes and salvage activities, IGRMS demonstrates the aesthetic qualities of India's traditional life styles, and the continued relevance of local traditional knowledge and mores of people to the modern society and cautions the people against unprecedented destruction of ecology and environment, local values and customs.</p>
