                            <p class="text"><b>History of Chanderi </b><br>The history of Chanderi has gone through many rulers, till it was transferred to Sindhias in Gwalior in 1861 by Huge Rose (1858-1861). The history of Chanderi started when the Ghyasuddin Balban captured the city in 1251 for Nasir ud Mahmud, Sultan of Delhi. Few years later Rana Sanga of Chittor established its capital at Chanderi and gave it to Medini Rai, the powerful wazir (Arabic term of Minister) of Mandu, after long ruled by Khilijis, mamluk's & Tugluk's in 1519. Years later Rajput's of Bundela incarcerated the city in 1586 and then came the time when Devi Singh was made a governor of the city. Chanderi is a rich town in terms of natural beauty and great culture infused by different kingdoms that ruled the region in the past. Some of the best places to visit in Chanderi are Babur's Mosque, Jauhar Monument, Khuni Darwaza, Jama & Juma Masjid, Badal Mahal, Jain Temple, Nizamuddin Tombs, and more.</p> 
        
                            <p class="text"><b>Chanderi Fort</b> is the most renowned monument of Chanderi. The fort stands proudly at a height of 71 m above the town on a hill. The fort is fortified with a 5 km long wall. This important attraction of Chanderi tourism was built by King Kirti Pal in the 11th century. The fort has witnessed several attacks and has been re-built a number of times. The fort has three gates for entrance. The uppermost gate is known as Hawa Paur, and the lowermost gate is known as Khooni Darwaza. The southwest side of the fort has an interesting gateway called the Katti-Ghatti. </p>
                            <p class="text"><b>Raja Mahal </b> is a seven storied palace standing proudly in the Andar Shehar of Chanderi. It is one of the few remaining palaces that still grace the landscape of Chanderi. Chanderi once had around 260 palaces, of which only 43 have managed to exist till date. The palace features architectural style of the 15th century. It is a beautiful structure constructed from grey and white sandstones and has elaborate carvings to display. The palace is truly a magnificent structure that has large courtyards, elegant stairways, beautifully carved pillars and open pavilions on the terrace.</p> 
                             <p class="text"><b>Chanderi Fabric </b>is believed to have originated from vedic period. In the fashion industry it occupies a significant place due to its weaving specialty. It is woven by three kind of threads; cotton, silk thread and Zari. Mainly, traditional looms are used for its production.                     Transparency is one of its unique features as itâ€™s not found in any other textile product across the country. Chanderi fabric gets its shine and transparency because of non- degumming of the raw yarn. Another important characteristic of chanderi is the motifs used on the fabric which are hand-woven with the use of needles. Motifs are inspired mostly from nature like swans, trees, flowers. Some motifs including nalferma, dandidar, chatai, jangla are most exclusive to chanderi weaves.</p>
