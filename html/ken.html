                        <p class = "text"  id="texttospeech">Spread over 45.2 sq km, Ken Gharial Sanctuary lies about 25 km north of Panna Tiger Reserve’s entry gate at Madla. It sits on a plateau that overlooks the Ken River with a series of escarpments that fall 100-150 feet into the river valley. The most spectacular part is a canyon, dubbed the “Grand Canyon of India”, that snakes continuously for 5 km. Its igneous rock is rich in colourful granite, dolomite, basalt, quartz and jasper, easily distinguishable on bright days when they shimmer in the sunlight.<br><br>A safari through the sanctuary is usually under two hours, with two main stops. The first is the Raneh Falls viewpoint, which is the sole attraction for many visitors. While the sanctuary is named for the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), another highlight is a series of waterfalls that plunge into the canyon over colourful rocks. The falls are spectacular during the monsoon when the water volume increases dramatically to form a continuous sheet of plunging water. At other times though, narrow streams rush through a few crags, making it equally magnificent. A boardwalk connects a few vantage points from where the falls and rocks can be viewed from different angles. During the dry months, it is also possible to see a volcanic crater that is believed to have erupted about 460 million years ago and created the series of gorges. Along the edges of the cliffs are beautiful kullu trees (Sterculia urens, also called ghost tree), their bark white and shimmering in the bright sun. Other species of trees such as tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon), salai (Bosswellia serrata) and kardhai (Anogeissus pendula) are also visible.<br><br>About 5 km north of the falls is the sanctuary’s second viewpoint, Crocodile Point, near the juncture where Ken and Khudar rivers meet. Here, there is no canyon and the sides slope down gently. The banks are packed with rocks and rocky formations providing plenty of relatively flat surfaces for muggers and gharials to sun themselves.<br><br>The mainstay of this sanctuary is the critically endangered gharial, a fish-eating crocodile whose snout ends in a bulbous knob (ghada or ghara), which is how it gets its name. Gharials are only found in some rivers of India and Nepal. There are only about 800-900 in the wild, and guides estimate about 105 live in the Ken river, following a successful reintroduction programme with gharials from Chambal. Yet, it is not easy to spot them. On the other hand, muggers (marsh crocodiles) are easily sighted on riverbanks. When driving to and from vantage points, or on forest trails, various animals come into view: nilgai, sambar, chinkara, chital, wild boar, and monkeys. Big cats are rare in this sanctuary, though leopards have been spotted a few times. The sanctuary has a variety of birds, but it is the vultures that are abundant and most eye-catching. The vertical craggy surfaces near Raneh Falls act as nesting sites, especially for Egyptian vultures. At a couple of spots within the sanctuary, a mix of Indian and Himalayan vultures can be spotted atop trees.<BR><BR>The Ken Gharial Sanctuary may be best known for its population of gharials but also has a wide variety of mammals such as the (top) langur, (above left) sambar, (above right) nilgai.</p>
