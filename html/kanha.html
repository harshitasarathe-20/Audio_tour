                        <p class="text">The largest national park in Madhya Pradesh with 941sq. km expansion, Kanha National Park is considered to be one of the best administered and managed parks in India. It is one of the Navratanas of the 'Project Tiger'.Kanha Tiger Reserve, also called Kanha National Park, is one of the tiger reserves of India and the largest national park of Madhya Pradesh, state in the heart of India. The present-day Kanha area is divided into two sanctuaries, Hallon and Banjar, of 250 and 300 km2 respectively. Kanha National Park was created on 1 June 1955 and in 1973 was made the Kanha Tiger Reserve. Today it stretches over an area of 940 km2 in the two districts Mandla and Balaghat.</p>
                        <p class="text">Apart from the majestic royal Bengal tigers, Kanha inhabits barasingha as well, which was very close to extinction. It was then a successful conservation programme at Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh, that brought the animal back. Therefore the park is respected globally for saving the barasingha from near extinction. It is interesting to know that 'Bhoorsingh the Barasingha' is the official mascot for Kanha National Park. You will also get to spot bison roaming freely in their natural surroundings of Kanha.</p>
