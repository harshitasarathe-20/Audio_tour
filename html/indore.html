                            <p class="text">The Patalpani Waterfall is located in the Mhow Tehsil of Indore district and is a popular picnic spot for the locals of the area. Surrounded by dense forest covers and majestic hills Patalpani plummets from a height of 300 metres. The monsoons swell the falls and may make it risky for close encounters causing accidents. It is best to maintain a cautious distance from the waterfall during the rain.</p>
                           <p class="text">Formed by the Choral River, the Pataipani Waterfall is cascading down from a height of about 91 meters (300 ft). The depth of the pond that forms at the bottom of the waterfall is unknown and legend has it that it goes as deep as patal. Therefore, the falls are called Patal-Pani, where Patal means the underworld and Pani means water in Hindi. Surrounded by dense forest covers, majestic hills, and lush green landscapes, it is one of the popular picnics spots near Indore, and an ideal photography spot too. The waterflow is magnanimous during the monsoons and the area is prone to flash floods. It is best to maintain a cautious distance from the waterfall during the rain. However, the waterfall goes almost dry in the summer season, and the stream is reduced to a trickle. A railway line passing along the area adds to the charm of the place.</p>

                        <p class="text">The Khajrana Ganesh temple is one of the most powerful shrines of the Lord Ganesha. It was built by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar to safeguard the idol of Lord Ganesha from Aurangzeb. The temple has since grown from being housed in a small hut to a big temple with large inner and outer sanctums. Vinayak Chaturthi is celebrated in a big way in the temple.</p>                  
                        <p class="text">Khajrana Ganesh Temple is dedicated to Lord Ganesh. This temple was built in 1735 by the Maratha queen Ahilyabai Holkar, who retrieved the idol of god Ganesha from a well where it had been hidden, to keep it safe from the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This is one of the most visited temples in the city because of its history and religious beliefs attached to it. According to several religious beliefs, it is said that whoever comes here and wishes for something, the wish gets fulfilled within a short period.</p>
                        <h3>Bada Ganpati</h3>
                        <p class="text">In Hindi, 'Bada' literally means big, and Ganpati is the pet name of Lord Ganesha. This temple earns its name due to the size of Lord Ganesha's idol - at the height of about 25 feet from crown to foot, it is said to be one of the largest idols of the God in the world. The statue is made of a peculiar mixture of limestone, jaggery, bricks and sacred soil and water from the major pilgrim places in the country. Located at the end of a quiet lane in the city of Indore, the Bada Ganpati may be a modest-looking temple, but it holds significance simply based on the enormity of the Lord's statue.</p>
