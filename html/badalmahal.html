At first glance, the Badal Mahal Chanderi seems to be a monument without purpose, The monument stands at the end of beautifully landscaped lawns, teasing you to guess the reason for its existence. To understand the rationale behind the building of the Badal Mahal Gate Chanderi, it is necessary to take a step back in history, to the 15th century.<br><br>The Badal Mahal Chanderi dates back in history to the times of Sultan Mahmud Khilji who ruled over the Malwa Sultanate which is now known as Madhya Pradesh. Sultan Mahmud Khalji was constantly engaged in military campaigns to expand his kingdom. He had frequent skirmishes with his arch-rival, Rana Kumbha of Mewar, present-day Rajasthan. He also marched into Gujarat and captured the Champaner fort. He also dared to challenge the might of the Delhi Sultanate and launched a military campaign, which proved to be unsuccessful<br>The Badal Mahal Darwaza was built during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Khalji in the 15th century to mark his victory in one of his many military campaigns. However, it is not known, which victory the Badal Mahal commemorates.<br><br>As you emerge from a semi-dark enclosure which is the entrance to the Badal Mahal Darwaza, you are stunned with the beauty that meets your eye. A straight paved path leads to the tall and imposing structure known as Badal Mahal. The path is flanked by beautifully landscaped gardens and lawns. They remind you of the Mughal gardens that one sees at the Taj Mahal and other Mughal monuments including the likes of Qutub Minar and other historical monuments of Delhi.It is ornamented with intricately carved designs, lattices, and motifs. The arch that crowns the structure is made up of a netted window or “Jali”, that is reminiscent of the famous Siddi Sayyed Jali of Ahmedabad in Gujarat.<br><br>Though the Badal Mahal Darwaza Chanderi is purported to be a gate, it leads to nowhere. At best, Badal Mahal is a facade, which looks stunning against the backdrop of a hill and the Kirti Durg Fort. A Few white clouds flitting in the backdrop add drama and meaning to the sight of the Badal Mahal.The Badal Mahal Gate Chanderi is an intriguing structure. Two exquisitely carved arches are stacked one above the other. There is an open space between them. These arches are flanked by tall Minarets on either side. If you look closely, you will be able to spot various religious motifs within the structure of the Badal Mahal Darwaza, the fact that these motifs are from different religions is a testimony to the secular character of Chanderi, where many cultures and religions co-existed in history.<br></p>
