                            <h3>Waterfalls In Pachmarhi</h3>
                            <h3>Bee waterfall </h3>
                            <p class="text">Bee waterfall is one of the most famous waterfalls located in Pachmarhi because of its intensity and the view of the area surrounding it. As the waterfall originates from perennial rivers, a pool is formed below the waterfall that is perfect for taking part in different water activities including swimming. The reason so many people love this fall is that the water available in the pool is quite clean. To reach the waterfall, you will have to climb down more than 400 steps though the route where the stairs are located is covered in the lush greenery of thick forests.</p>
                            <h3>Duchess waterfall </h3>
                            <p class="text">Duchess waterfall is located in the Bhrant Neer area of Pachmarhi that can be reached after undergoing a 4 km uphill trek. The reason this waterfall is immensely popular among nature lovers is that the waterfall originates as one stream by getting bifurcated into three different streams.</p>

                        <p class="text">Legend says that the 5 Pandava brothers had visited Pachmarhi during their exile. They excavated '5', means 'Pach' in Hindi, 'caves', which means 'marhi', for their shelter.</p>                  
                        <p class="text">As per the epic Mahabharata, the Pandavas were forced into exile on losing everything in a game of dice with the Kauravas. The Pandavas were to spend a year in anonymity as a part of their exile. Agreeing to these terms, the Pandavas set out. While passing through Pachmarhi, they excavated 5 caves in the sandstone hills for their shelter.</p>
                        <p class="text">These caves are still in existence and have gained popularity as a major tourist spot in Pachmarhi. But most geologists say that these caves must have been in existence even before the Mahabharata era.</p>

                            <p class="text">Chauragarh Temple is a revered Shiva shrine atop the Chauragarh hill in Pachmarhi, MP. Shaivite devotees have to climb nearly 1300 steps to reach the temple at the crest. The shrine is known for the thousands of tridents stuck in the temple premises, offered by devotees over the years. The view of the sunrise from here is quite breathtaking, so are the surrounding forested valleys.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text"> During Nag Panchami and Maha Shivratri festivals, devotees are seen climbing this steep path, carrying heavy Trishuls as a part of religious norms. Offering a Trishul is considered auspicious and is like thanksgiving, once the wish has been fulfilled. </p>

                        <p class="text">The Jata Shankar Caves in Pachmarhi are considered sacred as they are popularly believed to be the place where Lord Shiva concealed himself from the wrath of Bhasmasur.</p>                  
                        <p class="text">The caves boast of a natural Shivalingam under the shadow of a massive rock and the stone formation in the cave closely resemble the mythological hundred headed snake Seshnag. The rock formation in the caves resemble Lord Shiva's matted hair, hence the name. </p>
                        <p class="text">The cave contains stalagmites which are revered as naturally formed lingams. In fact, there are 108 such natural lingams present in this cave. There are two different types of ponds fed by springs, found in the locality, one of cold water and the other one of hot water. Water in the cave flows from an unknown point as no one has ever seen or reached that starting point and hence this stream of water is popularly known as 'Gupt Ganga'. It is believed that the Jambu Dwip stream originates from this cave. There are idols of Lord Shankar and Goddess Parvati enshrined at a platform on the upper section of the cave.</p>
