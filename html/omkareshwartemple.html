The name Omkareshwar means 'Lord of Omkaara', which is one of the Dwadasa Jyotirlinga shrines or the 12 shrines dedicated to lord Shiva in the form of a Jyotirlingam. It's a sacred island which is shaped like the Hindu symbols 'OM', drawing millions of travellers from all across the globe. It has two ancient shrines including Omkareshwar and Amarkareshwar. This holy place is located on the meeting point of Narmada and Kaveri River, making a must-visit pilgrimage destination for Lord Shiva devotees and leisure travellers alike. Set in the Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar is forged by the sacred Narmada River. Built in the Nagara style, the Omkareshwar temple is featured by an eminent Shikhara.<br><br>As per the myth, when Narad, the great prophet visited to the god of Vindhya Mountains, he was quite raging after knowing that there was no dwelling for Lord Shiva and so, the god of these mountains referred himself to very strict nonindulgences. Lord Shiva was very delighted when the deity of the mountain said that he would make Omkareshwar one of his homes and that's why the place is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Over and above, the entire area of this holy place is bordered by mountains, making an enchanting view for travellers. If you're here you must take a Parikrama around the island as it is considered to be very religious and you'll feel relax and peace a here.<br><br>Omkareshwar has two lofty hills and it’s divided by a valley, creating a shape of the sacred Hindu symbol ‘OM’ from above. It is said that  Lord Shiva  visit here to sleep  or ‘Shayan’ every night and so ‘Shayan Arti’ is performed   here
                             It is believed that  worshiping Omkareshwar is synonymous  to  visiting  and worshipping Kedarnath  and Panch Kedars.<br>When the Mughal emperor and Mahmud Gazni attacked several Hindu temples in the 11th century, Omkareshwar temple was one of them but it luckily stay alive in the attack and later it became one of the most popular holy places for Hindu pilgrims.</p>
