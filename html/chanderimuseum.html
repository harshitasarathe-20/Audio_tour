The collections housed in the Chanderi Museum have been primarily discovered from a place known as Budhi Chanderi located at a distance of about 19 kilometers. Budhi Chanderi was the old settlement of Chanderi town and dates back to mythological times. It was earlier known as Chaidnagar and is even mentioned in the Mahabharata.<br><br>The Chanderi Museum consists of 5 galleries. One gallery is dedicated to Jainism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism, while another gallery documents the history of Chanderi, the fifth gallery is called Anandam Gallery. The town has been the epicenter of different religions and faiths across history. These include Jainism, Islam, Shaivism, Buddhism, Vaishnavism, and others. The glorious past of Chanderi comes alive beautifully in stone within the galleries of the ASI Museum Chanderi.<br><br>The Chanderi Museum is a very neat and well-maintained museum. The beautifully designed museum building is set amidst enchantingly landscaped gardens. But what rivets your attention as you near the entrance to the museum is a unique brick-red statue, that stands unobtrusively in a corner. The statue is that of the Hindu God Shiva, also referred to as Rudra. The statue is said to represent the Pashupatinath form of Rudra. Pashupatinath literally means, “Lord of all Animals”.<br>The statue of Shiva is not original. It is a replica of one that dates back to somewhere between the 4th and 5th century AD during the Gupta period. The original was found near a village by the name of Tala in the Bilaspur district of Chattisgarh.<br><br>This is a gallery that showcases the history and heritage of Chanderi and the surrounding regions right from pre-historic times. The exhibits here include pre-historic paintings, paleolithic and neolithic tools, and ornaments, pottery and ornaments, and other objects made of iron and other metals. The gallery also houses beautiful sculptures associated with Jainism, Vaishnavism, and Shaivism, that prevailed in the region across history.<br><br>One of the most spectacular galleries in the museum is the Vaishnava gallery. Seen here are some amazing sculptures of the Hindu deity Vishnu and his different avatars.<br><br><b>Vaishnava Gallery</b> is one of the most spectacular galleries in the museum is the Vaishnava gallery. Seen here are some amazing sculptures of the Hindu deity Vishnu and his different avatars. One of the exhibits not to be missed is that of the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. Vishnu is depicted as a boar. The beautiful sculpture is embellished with intricate carvings across its body.<BR><BR><b>Shaiva and Sakta </b>gallery is dedicated to Shiva and Shakti worship. It has beautiful sculptures of Shiva and Shakti in their different forms. One of the most beautiful depictions of Shiva and Parvati shows the divine couple in an intimate moment. Parvati is seated on Shiva’s lap and has her right arm around him. Parvati has the hint of a smile on her lips, however, Shiva looks pensive as if he has received some information and has to leave.<br><br><b>Jaina Gallery</b>is a timeline of the growth of Jainism in the region. It houses exquisite sculptures of different Jain Tirthankaras. These include beautiful sculptures of Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankara, as well as those of Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara, Parshvanatha the 23rd Tirthankara, Neminatha the 22nd Tirthankara, and many others.<br><br><b>Anandam Gallery</b>documents the Mughal influence on Chanderi. It has Mughal paintings, inscriptions, and other artifacts related to the various Mughal monuments of Chanderi. The gallery also has a collection of coins, weapons, and other objects related to different dynasties that ruled over the region.</p>
