The park is recognized as one of the major destination opted for the tiger project on the wage of continuing the essential tiger project in India. by spreading across an area of 105 sq km the name Bandhavgarh has been acquired from the most prominent hillock of the area, flourished with high biodiversity and since the area is filled with large density of tiger population, Bandhavgarh stands among the most regarded national park preferably for tiger tours which is being visited at the best season of 15th of October to till 30th of June.<br><br>The Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve has great connection with ancient legends and beliefs and the name also has ancient values with Ramayana, an old epic from Treta Yuga, which can be learnt from the ancient books of Narad Panch Ratra and Shiv Purana. The word Bandhavgarh is a concoction of two words: Bandhav & Garh where 'Bandhav' means brother and 'Garh' means Fort. So the meaning of Bandhavgarh is brother's fort.<br><br>The presence of an ancient fort bearing the same name has equivalent value to attract many archeologist and heritage lovers amidst the pristine jungle area. It is said that Lord Rama gifted this fort to his younger brother Lakshmana after returning from Lanka after killing Ravana on the way to Ayodhya. The Bandhavgarh fort is scripted with many convincing evidences of human activities and architectural techniques and interestingly, the legend also tells that the ruined fort was being reconstructed by the monkeys who built a bridge between Lanka and the mainland. The fort also brings several man made caves with inscriptions and rock paintings.<br><br>The land boasts of tremendous counts of several species like Asiatic Jackal, Bengal Fox, Sloth Bear, Ratel, Gray Mongoose, Striped Hyena, Jungle Cat, Leopard, Tiger, Wild Pigs, Spotted Deer, Sambar, Chausingha, Nilgai, Chinkara and Gaur, Dhole, the small Indian Civet, Palm Squirrel, Lesser Bandicoot Rat, Gaur, Common Langurs and Rhesus Macaque.<br><br>The foliage found in Bandhavgarh is mostly of dry deciduous type and is the only region which is quite rich in flora and fauna. The area brings relatively moderate climate and of course the favorable topography that uniquely supports the growth of a rich and varied flora in the park.</p>
