The forests surrounding Amarkantak have a rich variety of plants with medicinal properties, which make it extremely significant from an ecological point of view.

This can be witnessed at Mai Ki Bagiya, which is a grove of mango and banana trees.</p>
                        <p class="text">Three rivers - the holy Narmada, the Sone and the Johila emerge here from the womb of Amarkantak.

                            <p class="text">Dugdha Dhara is another waterfall near Kapil Dhara. The flow of water looks as white as milk (Dugdha) therefore this name is given.

                        <p class="text">The most prominent feature of this temple is the huge sculpture with 4 heads at the entrance. The heads represent the faces of Goddess Laxmi, Saraswati, Kali&Bhuvaneshwari. Beneath them are finely sculpted figures of 64 yoginis along with the sculptures of Lord Ganesha&Kartik. The temple itself is built as a 3D projection of the Sri Yantra / Sri Chakra which forms the core of the Sri Vidya worship in Hinduism. This branch worships the divine power of the Goddess Tripura Sundari or the Empress beauty of the Three Worlds. In essence it is the geometric representation of the concept of Shakti.</p>
