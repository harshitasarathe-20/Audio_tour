                        <h3>Shesh Shaiya â€“ The Vishnu Statue Inside Bandhavgarh National Park</h3>
                        <p class = "text"  id="texttospeech">The jungles of Bandhavgarh hold stories that are fascinating from times that have gone by even though the tigers inhabit it due to restricted access. Amidst this greenery and atop a hill lies the statue of Lord Vishnu fondly known as the Shesh Shaiya of Bandhavgarh National Park, calm about the wildlife or maybe guarding the jungle. This is the only place in the whole forest that you are allowed to get off the vehicle and explore on foot. The legend of Shesh Shaiya dates back to a dynasty that I hear for the first time called the Kalachuri Dynasty. <br><br>Covered in moss is the 35 feet long Lord Vishnu found in a reclining position. He is seen resting on the seven-headed serpent called Sheshnaag, and hence he gets the name "Shesh Shaiya." <br>It is not just the Lord Vishnu statue there. There is a Shiva Linga to the left, and there is Brahma to His right. However, the Brahma statue is just not visible, and there are roots all over it. But the idea was to set up a Trimoorthy (Trinity of Gods) in this place, and that is what is seen.<br><br>Vishnu statue is carved out of a single sandstone. And from his feet originates the perennial river called "Charan Ganga" .The river never dries up, and the whole of Bandhavgarh benefits from this river. In old scriptures, this river is addressed as Vetravali Ganga. The pond in front of him always has water. The presence of blue-green algae all over it stood as a testimony. Since it is a water hole with water all through the year, it is typical for the tiger and leopard, and other wildlife to quench their thirst. I stood there watching the sun rays illuminating the entire place.<br><br>The origins of the park and the fort dates draws its mythological origins from times as old as Ramayana. The remnants of lived-in caves, shrine structures inside the park indicate a lot of influence by the worship of Lord Vishnu and perhaps the biggest sign of it is the Shesh Shaiya, a reclining statue of Lord Vishnu at the spring of the Chakradhara stream that waters the Tala pond. </p>
