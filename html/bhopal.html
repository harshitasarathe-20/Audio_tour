                        <p class = "text">Bhopal also known as the 'City of Royals' has a long, important history.Bhopal was formerly a part of Bhopal princely state, which was founded in 1723 by Dōst Moḥammad Khan, an Afghan adventurer, and was the second largest Muslim principality of the British Empire. In its struggles with the Marathas, Bhopal was friendly to the British and concluded a treaty with them at the outbreak of the Pindari War in 1817. The Bhopal Agency, created in 1818, was a subdivision of the British Central India Agency and comprised the princely states of Bhopal, Rajgarh, Narsinghgarh, and several others. The headquarters was at Sehore. Between 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by the generation of Begums for over 100 years, who gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality. </p>    
                       <p class="text">Bhopal was constituted a municipality in 1903. At India’s independence in 1947, Bhopal remained a separate province until 1949, when it acceded to India. In 1952 the nawab’s absolute rule was abolished, and a chief commissioner’s state was established. It merged with Madhya Pradesh in 1956, and Bhopal replaced Nagpur as the state capital.</p>
                       <p class="text">Between 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by the generation of Begums for over 100 years, who gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality. The four Queens, Qudsia Begum (1819-37), Sikander Begum (1844-68), Shah Jahan Begum (1868-1901), and Sultan Jahan Begum (1901-1926) were great reformists and patrons of education, art, culture and public works. They also built several great monuments, which still stand as testimonies to the city's celebrated past.</p>
                        <p class = "text">Bhopal is adorned by beautiful lakes and striking landscapes. Towards the north, you'll be welcomed by the old city that encompasses fascinating mosques, serpentine alleys, amazing food corners and buzzing chowks. On the other side of the upper lake is new Bhopal. Modern, with wide roads, shopping complexes, plush hotels and restaurants. Both contrast flanks are well-connected and offer something for every taste!</p>

                        <p class="text">Moti Masjid is one of the many mosques located in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Even though the mosque is relatively smaller in size as compared to the other exquisite and historical monuments that stand majestically in the 'city of mosques', the Moti Masjid is of equal importance. This famous historic landmark was built by Sikander Jehan Begum of Bhopal, daughter of Qudusiya Begum, in the year 1860. Sikander Begum was an unconventional woman who abolished slavery and set up the trend of the progressive woman in the entire city. Popularly known as the Pearl Mosque, the mosque is located in the heart of the city and represents the rich history of the Bhopal Begums in India.
                        <p class="text">The architecture of the Moti Masjid in Bhopal has a striking resemblance to the architecture of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, except for the size. The Moti Masjid features a white marble facade with two small cupolas on the top. The two dark red towers on either side of the primary structure of the mosque are equally beautiful and fascinating.</p>

Upper Lake is the most significant lake of Bhopal commonly known as the Bhojtal. It’s the oldest human-made lake in the country that lies on the west of Bhopal. The locals also call it Bada Talab. Serving around 30 million gallons of water the lake is a primary source of potable water to the residents of the city.</p>
                        <p class="text">This beautiful vast water body was named after King Bhoj who built the lake across Kolans River in the 11th-century. According to the folklore, the king constructed this humongous lake to cure himself of his skin disease. The pillar on one corner of the lake holds the statue of Raja Bhoj. The Upper Lake is separated from the lower lake by an overbridge called Pul Pukhta.
