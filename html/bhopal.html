                        <p class="text" id="texttospeech">Bhopal also known as the 'City of Royals' has a long, important history.Bhopal was formerly a part of Bhopal princely state, which was founded in 1723 by Dōst Moḥammad Khan, an Afghan adventurer, and was the second largest Muslim principality of the British Empire. In its struggles with the Marathas, Bhopal was friendly to the British and concluded a treaty with them at the outbreak of the Pindari War in 1817. The Bhopal Agency, created in 1818, was a subdivision of the British Central India Agency and comprised the princely states of Bhopal, Rajgarh, Narsinghgarh, and several others. The headquarters was at Sehore. Between 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by the generation of Begums for over 100 years, who gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality.<br><br>Bhopal was constituted a municipality in 1903. At India’s independence in 1947, Bhopal remained a separate province until 1949, when it acceded to India. In 1952 the nawab’s absolute rule was abolished, and a chief commissioner’s state was established. It merged with Madhya Pradesh in 1956, and Bhopal replaced Nagpur as the state capital.<br><br>Between 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by the generation of Begums for over 100 years, who gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality. The four Queens, Qudsia Begum (1819-37), Sikander Begum (1844-68), Shah Jahan Begum (1868-1901), and Sultan Jahan Begum (1901-1926) were great reformists and patrons of education, art, culture and public works. They also built several great monuments, which still stand as testimonies to the city's celebrated past.<br><br>Bhopal is adorned by beautiful lakes and striking landscapes. Towards the north, you'll be welcomed by the old city that encompasses fascinating mosques, serpentine alleys, amazing food corners and buzzing chowks. On the other side of the upper lake is new Bhopal. Modern, with wide roads, shopping complexes, plush hotels and restaurants. Both contrast flanks are well-connected and offer something for every taste!</p>
