                            <p class="text">The Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga is one of the 12 revered jyotirlinga shrines of Lord Shiva in India. According to legend, Vindhya, the deity controlling the Vindhyachal mountain ranges was worshipping Lord Shiva to cleanse his soul of the sins committed by him. He created a sacred Lingam with sand and clay. Impressed by his devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him in two forms- Omkareshwar and Amareshwar. The island is said to be in the shape of the Hindu 'OM' symbol which makes this land even more divine.</p>
                            <p class="text">
                                The temple boasts Nagara-style architecture with detailed and intricate carvings. This 5 storied temple has a grand Sabha Mandap (prayer hall) standing on about 60 huge elaborately carved pillars. One can see the Mahakal temple on the first floor, Omkareshwar Temple on the second floor, Siddhnatha temple on the 3rd floor, Gupteswar temple on the 4th floor, and Rajeshwar Mahadev temple on the 5th floor. All these temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva and these are different names of Lord Shiva. Inside, the Omkar Shivlinga is established along with Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesh. Jyotirlinga is always surrounded by water. Besides, the circular path around Omkar hill (Parikrama path) has several temples and ashrams. The path is about 6 km long and takes 2-3 hours to complete. </p>

                        <p class="text">Located on Omkar Parikramapath, Gauri Somnath Temple is believed to have been built in the 11th century AD and is one of several shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in Omkareshwar. The temple is very well known for its huge Shivlinga and statue of Nandi. </p>                  
                       
                        <p class="text">Gauri Somnath Temple has been constructed in the Bhumji style of architecture. The temple has three storeys and has the shape of a peahen. With its rising curvilinear tower and high platform, the temple has a striking resemblance to the Khajuraho temples. The sanctum sanctorum houses a gigantic six feet tall shiv linga made of a black stone with a shiny black texture. There is a sitting Nandi(Scared bull) of similar stone outside. Also, one can find the idol of Goddess Parvati, consort of Shiva, behind the linga. </p>

                            <p class="text">The Siddhanath Temple is a 13th-century temple built in Brahminic and Indo Nagara architecture style. Situated on a plateau on the Mandhata island, the temple is architecturally one of the most visually stunning monuments in the whole of Omkareshwar and is a protected monument. The temple is the perfect example of ancient Indian ingenuity and architectural prowess. The temple was attacked by Mahmud of Ghazni but it still stands tall symbolizing its strength.</p>
                            <p class="text">Siddhanath Temple is situated nearly at the end of the Omkareshwar Parikrama. It is supported by a huge podium whose 4 sides have been ornamented with figures and mural art paintings. The frescos of elephants are the main attraction of this temple, which is carved in stone 1.5m in height. The central shrine is accessible from four sides and exquisite carvings can be seen on the walls and pillars of the temple. Also, there is a cluster of Hindu and Jain temples, all remarkable for their skillful use of varied architectural modes.</p>
