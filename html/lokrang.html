During the festival, the stage displays the various forms of folk dances, music, and ethnic dances. Also, one can see the beautiful collections of fans and handicrafts made by the tribal community of Madhya Pradesh. This festival's actual motive is to erase the geopolitical demarcations, make India a unified whole and to revive the year old tradition. Lokrang fest is organized by the Madhya Pradesh Adivasi Lok Kala Academy.<br><br>It is also deemed as ‘Lokrang Samaroh’ in a local dialect. The word ‘Lokrang’ is an amalgamation of two different words, ‘Lok’ which means people, and ‘Rang’ which means colour. The Lokrang is amongst the most famous fairs and festivals in Madhya Pradesh. The five-day-long spectacular show of folk dance and music commences on the Republic Day of India, 26th January, every year. From teenyboppers to superannuitants, this cultural event has something for everyone’s entertainment.<br><br>This extravagant exhibition of vibrant culture, ancient colourful art forms, and melodious music from every corner of the country and the globe includes eight different events, dedicated to their respectful aptitude making it one of the must-do things to do in Madhya Pradesh. The festival is celebrated for the past 19 years in the constituency of Bhopal. <br><br>Since India is a country of many states and each state has its own cultural background, the organizing committee of this festival aims to speculate on each of them. The theme of the festival is decided beforehand, sometimes they showcase the cultural diversity of North-East India, and sometimes they aim to portray the customs of the Western part of the country.<br><br> The main reason behind Lokrang festivasl was -    After the 200 years long British rule and globalization, the cultural significance of India slowly began to dissipate from its genomes and the people started to incline more towards the western culture. This transformation of culture amongst people resulted in the disappearance of the Indian way of life. That’s why the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board decided to begin a five-day celebration of ancient culture, dance, music, and art. This helped many little know tribes, villages, and artists to make their lives better. Most of the cultural mores that are performed and showcased in this festival were on the doorsill of extinction and the organizing committees do their best to revive them. <br><br> An event known as Ramayni is dedicated to theatrical representations. The main highlight of the event is a performance from the Gond Tribe.<br>An event solely dedicated to promoting the heritage of Indian culture is also organized which is called Dharohar. Dance and music performances from different states of the country are showcased in this event.<br>The folk musicians from Madhya Pradesh flaunt their talent in an event called Lokrag. After all, it’s their festival the world celebrates.<br>The artists from outside of India can show their talents in another affair called Deshantar which is dedicated to foreign artists only.<br><br>India is filled with art and it is not limited to just dance and music. Handcrafts is a well-celebrated art form in our country and there is a special place for it in this Madhya Pradesh Festival called Aakar which means shapes in English.<br>There is also an event for book lovers which is known as Lokwarta. If you like the smell of old books and Indian literature then you should be here. This event exhibits the vibrant culture, art, and old literature of India.</p>
